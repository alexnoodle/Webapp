The mainView.html and style.css files are the files that contain the html and
style for the view. The asstronaut.jpg file also needs to be in the same
directory since it is used as the background image for mainView.html. The api is
stored in api.py and the relevant tests are in api_tests.py. All of these files
can be found on thacker in var/www/html/cs257/schneidera/webapp.
